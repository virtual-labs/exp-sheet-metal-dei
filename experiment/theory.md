## 1. Introduction

Sheet metal is simply metal formed into thin and flat pieces. It is one of the fundamental forms used in metalworking, and can be cut and bent into a variety of different shapes. Countless everyday objects are constructed of the material. Thicknesses can vary significantly, although extremely thin thicknesses are considered foil or leaf, and pieces thicker than 6 mm (0.25 in) are considered plate.

## 2. Sheet Metal Processing

The raw material for sheet metal manufacturing processes is the output of the rolling process. Typically, sheets of metal are sold as flat, rectangular sheets of standard size. If the sheets are thin and very long, they may be in the form of rolls. Therefore the first step in any sheet metal process is to cut the correct shape and sized **blank** from larger sheet.

## 3. Sheet Metal Forming Processes

Sheet metal processes can be broken down into two major classifications and one minor classification:

- **Shearing processes:** processes which apply shearing forces to cut, fracture, or separate the material.
- **Forming processes:** processes which cause the metal to undergo desired shape changes without failure, excessive thinning, or cracking. This includes bending and stretching.
- **Finishing processes:** processes which are used to improve the final surface characteristics.

## 3.1 Shearing Process

### 1. Punching

Punching is a metal forming process that uses a punch press to force a tool, called a punch, through the workpiece to create a hole via shearing. The punch often passes through the work into a die. A scrap slug from the hole is deposited into the die in the process. Depending on the material being punched this slug may be recycled and reused or discarded.

Punching is often the cheapest method for creating holes in sheet metal in medium to high production volumes. When a specially shaped punch is used to create multiple usable parts from a sheet of material the process is known as blanking.

In forging applications the work is often punched while hot, and this is called hot punching. Production rate of this process is very high so it is good for industrial purpose. A die is located on the opposite side of the workpiece and supports the material around the perimeter of the hole and helps to localize the shearing forces for a cleaner edge.

There is a small amount of clearance between the punch (upper die) and the lower die to prevent the punch from sticking in the die. The amount of clearance depends on the thickness and hardness of the workpiece and is always less than the thickness of the sheet.

A pressure pad is also used to provide proper pressure on the working sheet.

### 2. Blanking

Blanking is a shearing process using a die and punch where the exterior portion of the shearing operation is to be discarded.

### 3. Perforating
Punching a number of holes in a sheet.

### 4. Parting
Shearing the sheet into two or more pieces.

### 5. Notching
Removing pieces from the edges.

### 6. Lancing
Leaving a tab without removing any material.

## 3.2 Forming Processes

### 3.2.1 Sheet Metal Bending

#### Introduction
Bending is a manufacturing process by which metal can be deformed by plastically deforming the material and changing its shape. The material is stressed beyond its yield strength but below its ultimate tensile strength. There is little change to the materials surface area. Bending generally refers to deformation about one axis only.

Bending along a straight line is the most common of all sheet forming processes; it can be done in various ways such as forming along the complete bend in a die, or by wiping, folding or flanging in special machines.

Bending is done using Press Brakes. Press Brakes can normally accommodate stock from 1 m to 4.5 m. Thickness can vary significantly, although extremely thin thicknesses are considered foil or leaf, and pieces thicker than 6 mm are considered plate. The thickness of the sheet metal is called its gauge.

---

### Bend Allowances

When sheet metal is bent, the inside surface of the bend is compressed and the outer surface of the bend is stretched. Somewhere within the thickness of the metal lies its Neutral Axis, which is a line in the metal that is neither compressed nor stretched.

![Tension and Compression in the Bend Area](images/bend_tension_compression.png)

In practical terms, if we want a work piece with a 90 degree bend in which one leg measures A and the other B, then the total flat length is not A + B.

![Bending Allowance Attributes](images/bending_allowance_attributes.png)

Where:  
Ab = bend allowance  
a = bend angle  
R = bend radius  
t = stock thickness  
Kba = factor to estimate stretching  

- If R < 2t, Kba = 0.33  
- If R = 2t, Kba = 0.50  

---

### Spring Back

Because all materials have a finite modulus of elasticity, plastic deformation is followed by elastic recovery upon removal of load. In bending, this recovery is known as spring back. The spring back usually ranges from 5 to 10 degrees.

![Spring Back after Bending](images/spring_back.png)

Where:  
Ri and Rf = initial and final bend radii  
Y = yield strength  
E = modulus of elasticity  
T = thickness  

---

### Bending Force

The equation for estimating the maximum bending force depends on material strength, thickness, and length of sheet.

---

### Types of Bending Processes

#### I. Air Bending
Punch touches workpiece but does not bottom into the die. Less force is required and spring back occurs.

![Air Bending](images/air_bending.png)

---

#### II. Bottoming
Sheet is forced into the V opening of the die. Very little spring back occurs, but higher force is required.

---

#### III. Coining
Coining is a cold working process similar to forging. It uses extremely high pressure to plastically deform metal.

Coining improves surface hardness and produces fine details. It is commonly used for coins, medals, buttons, and badges.

## 3.2.2 Stretching

## 3.2.3 Deep Drawing

Deep Drawing is a sheet metal process in which metal sheet is radially drawn into a forming die by the mechanical action of a punch. The process is considered deep when the depth exceeds the diameter.
