Detailed step-by-step procedure for common sheet metal operations (shearing, bending, punching, forming).

---

## 1. Preparation
1. Begin by wearing all necessary safety gear such as gloves, goggles, and closed-toe shoes.  
2. Select the sheet metal of appropriate material and thickness depending on the required operation.  
3. Ensure that the sheet is clean, free from rust, oil, and dust. Use emery paper if needed.  
4. Inspect tools and machines (shearing, bending, punching) to ensure they are properly adjusted and safe to use.

## 2. Marking and Layout
1. Using a steel ruler, try square, and scriber, mark the required dimensions on the sheet metal.  
2. Double-check all measurements to avoid errors during cutting.  
3. Use a center punch to create small indentations at points where holes or cuts will be made, ensuring accuracy during punching or drilling.  
4. Draw bend lines, cut lines, and reference lines clearly.

## 3. Shearing Operation (Cutting)
1. Position the sheet on the bed of the shearing machine with the marked line aligned to the blade.  
2. Adjust the back gauge or front gauge depending on the required cut length.  
3. Hold the sheet securely to avoid shifting during cutting.  
4. Operate the shearing lever/pedal slowly and steadily to complete the cut.  
5. Remove the cut piece and inspect for burrs or rough edges.  
6. Smooth the edges using a file.

## 4. Bending Operation
1. Place the cut sheet between the clamping bars of the bending machine (press brake or hand brake).  
2. Align the bend line on the sheet with the edge of the die or brake.  
3. Tighten the clamp to hold the sheet firmly in position.  
4. Apply gradual pressure to bend the sheet to the desired angle (e.g., 45°, 90°, etc.).  
5. Release the clamp and check the bend using a bevel protractor.  
6. If spring-back occurs, perform slight over-bending to achieve accurate angle.

## 5. Punching / Blanking
1. Select the correct size punch and die set based on the hole diameter or blank required.  
2. Position the sheet properly over the die and align the center punch marks with the punch axis.  
3. Activate the punch press manually or mechanically to create the hole or blank.  
4. Remove the punched piece and check for roundness, burrs, or cracks.  
5. File the edges to finish the surface.

## 6. Forming Operation (If Applicable)
1. Place the sheet metal on the forming die, block, or cylindrical shape.  
2. Using a mallet (not a steel hammer), strike gently and uniformly to form the sheet.  
3. Move the sheet gradually to maintain uniform thickness and avoid wrinkling.  
4. Continue forming until the required shape (cup, dome, or curve) is achieved.

## 7. Finishing and Inspection
1. Smooth all sharp edges using a metal file.  
2. Remove burrs formed during shearing or punching.  
3. Measure final dimensions using Vernier caliper, steel rule, and protractor.  
4. Compare the finished job with the initial design or drawing.  
5. Record defects, if any, such as cracks, warping, uneven bending, or inaccurate hole diameter.

## 8. Cleanup
1. Clean the work area and machines after completing the experiment.  
2. Return tools to their proper location.  
3. Dispose of metal scraps safely.
